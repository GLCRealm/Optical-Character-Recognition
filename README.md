# Optical-Character-Recognition
OCR model for capital english alphabet using tessaract.
Trained model is saved in form of pkl file.
Used tessract to get characters from the written test.
Works better on image with black background as provided in the test dataset file.
Run the file names as compete.py keeping all the files in the same place.

Thank You.
